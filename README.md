#### git
```ruby
https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches


Setting your branch to exactly match the remote branch can be done in two steps:

git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master


resets to the last committed state. In this case HEAD refers to the HEAD of your branch.
git reset --hard HEAD 



refresh new .git file for new user 

rm -rf .git

or 

git init for fresh one 

merg commit from terminal 
Simply doing the vim "save and quit" command :wq should do the trick.
